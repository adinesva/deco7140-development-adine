                    <p>
                        I use GenAI while doing my week 5 studio works. Firstly,
                        I use it to generate helper classes for spacing, margin,
                        and padding. The starting prompt is ‚ÄúI want to create
                        helper classes to help with spacing on my webpage. I
                        want them for both margin and padding as well as options
                        for top, bottom, start, end and x (start and end), and y
                        (top and bottom). I also want to set the spacing using
                        variables so I can adjust the spacing easily if needed.
                        The format of the classes should be, for example, m-1,
                        m-x-3, p-s-4, etc.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Then, I also use GenAI to ask why the emoji is outside
                        the box. It is to debug my code and find what's wrong
                        with my code, especially in CSS layout.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        GenAI has helped me to generate some styles for the CSS
                        component and layout, and I can say this is one of the
                        most effective way of learning as well. Since, after the
                        initial code was generated, I made some modifications,
                        such as the colors, padding, and spacing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, there are some ethical considerations; we have
                        to be responsible in its usage. While using AI, we have
                        to acknowledge and reference it. Sometimes, AI systems
                        often inherit biases from the data they're trained on,
                        this should be taken into account and recheck the
                        information, especially while doing GenAI user
                        interviews.

                    <p>
                        I use GenAi to brainstorm some ideas for the values,
                        needs and features analysis for the client brief page.
                        GenAi has helped me to generate some initial ideas
                        according to the client and user's needs, also helped me
                        in making engaging copywriting for a website.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        I also use GenAi to brainstorm some accessibility
                        guidelines ideas. This is an effective way to summarize
                        information and learn about accessibility guidelines
                        quickly, and generate some initial ideas. Further, it
                        can help me in determining whether the guidelines is
                        essential for the website or not, since I am a complete
                        beginner in accessibility guidelines, despite having a
                        design experience before.

                    <p>
                        I also use GenAi to generate ideas regarding ethical
                        issues present while making the website. While AI is
                        quick and practical to generate ideas, we still have to
                        recheck because AI could make mistakes and ensure the
                        information obtained is accurate and suitable for the
                        tasks, and be responsible about the data.
