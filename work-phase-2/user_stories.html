                                or followed some ‚Äúinternational student in Brisbane‚Äù pages on Instagram. Honestly, it was stressful sometimes because the info was

                            <p>
                                Yeah‚Ä¶ I can think of one time that really stuck with me. When I first arrived, I was trying to <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" data-userstory="As a newcomer, I want a step-by-step guide to renting in Australia so that I understand bonds, inspections, and applications, and the procedure to rent housing here.">find a shared apartment</span>close to my university.
                                I found a listing on a Facebook group that looked perfect‚Äîit had a good price, close to public transport, everything seemed fine.
                                But when I contacted the person, the info wasn‚Äôt really accurate, and I started to feel kind of lost and stressed because I didn‚Äôt know who to trust.
                                That was definitely a moment where I felt unsupported.<br>
                                On the other hand, I remember the first time I found my university‚Äôs international student support page‚Äîit had guides about opening a bank account,
                                getting a transport card, and even some tips about healthcare. That really made me feel supported, because the info was clear, reliable, and specifically for students like me. It saved me so much time and worry.
                                Honestly, those experiences showed me how important it is for newcomers to have trusted, centralized information. Otherwise, you just feel like you‚Äôre drowning in a sea of random tips and posts.

                            <p>Hmm‚Ä¶ for me, trust and return-ability would come from a few key things:</p>

                            <li class="p-1">

                                I found some tips on a Facebook group for international students, but most of the advice was outdated or conflicting.
                                I ended up applying to a few places and got rejected because I hadn't done things properly.
                                That made me feel really unsupported‚ÄîI didn't know where to find clear, reliable info. On the other hand, the university orientation week was a completely different experience.
                                They gave us guides about campus facilities, how to enroll in classes, student support services, and even some tips about living in Brisbane. That was the first time I felt supported, because the info was clear, trustworthy,
                                and meant for students like me. It made settling in a lot less stressful. Honestly, these experiences showed me how important it is to have centralized, reliable info for newcomers. Otherwise, you just feel lost and unsure who or what to trust.

                                PhD-specific gap ‚Äì Most university info was tailored for undergrads.
                                As a PhD student, I struggled to find resources or events that actually fit my stage of study.

                                Too much noise ‚Äì Facebook groups and forums had so many posts,
                                but not everything was useful. Sifting through it all was draining.
                            </li>
                            <li class="p-1">
                                Cultural and system differences ‚Äì Even though my English is fine, I didn‚Äôt fully understand how renting contracts work here,
                                or what‚Äôs normal in student life in Australia. That learning curve was tough.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It often felt like I was spending more energy searching for trustworthy info than actually settling in.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="question p-y-3">Can you tell me about a time when you felt supported (or unsupported)
                        by the information available to you as a newcomer?</p>
                        <div class="response p-x-3">

                                Yeah, one moment comes to mind right away. When I was apartment-hunting, I found a few listings on Facebook groups that seemed perfect‚Äîcheap rent, close to campus.
                                But when I messaged the posters, things felt off: vague answers, pressure to pay quickly, no proper inspection.
                                That was a time I felt really unsupported, because I didn‚Äôt know where to turn for verified housing info.
                                It made me second-guess every option and left me stressed for weeks. On the flip side, 
                                I remember attending a ‚ÄúWelcome to Research‚Äù session organized by the university.
                                They gave a step-by-step guide about setting up bank accounts, using healthcare, and even shared mental health resources.
                                That was one of the few times I felt genuinely supported‚Äîthe info was clear, official, and tailored for people like me starting out in a new environment. 
                                The difference between those two experiences showed me how crucial it is to have a trusted central hub. 
                                Without it, you‚Äôre just piecing things together and hoping for the best.

                                Websites ‚Äì My first choice for official or structured info (housing processes,
                                university services, government resources).
                                I feel more confident when the info looks official and up to date.

                                Facebook groups, Instagram pages, and even WhatsApp groups are useful,
                                but they can get noisy and messy.

                                Word of mouth ‚Äì Honestly, some of the best advice I‚Äôve gotten is just from chatting
                                with other students who‚Äôve been here longer.
                                It feels more trustworthy because it‚Äôs based on lived experience.

                        <p>The problem is that I often need to bounce between all these channels just to get a full picture, which is exhausting.
