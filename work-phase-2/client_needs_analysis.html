                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>
                    We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1"
                        >social cohesion</span
                    >
                    by empowering diverse communities to share their stories,
                    connect with others, and access resources that enhance their
                    visibility and influence. Our mission is to strengthen
                    societal bonds by creating platforms that celebrate and
                    support the unique identities of communities across
                    Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams
                    at Connect Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is
                    tasked with developing individual concepts and prototypes
                    for dynamic websites that align with CCIâ€™s mission and
                    vision. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds by

                    the unique identities of communities across Australia.

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We are commissioning the development of dynamic,
                    user-friendly websites that
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 3">
                        represent and support different communities.</span
                    >
                    Each website should serve as a central hub where community
                    members can share resources, highlight events, and foster
                    meaningful connections. The websites must not include any
                    form of commercial activity, such as advertising or selling
                    products. However, it is acceptable to promote resources,
                    events, or services that are directly beneficial to the
                    community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The websites must be accessible, mobile-friendly, and
                    reflect the diverse needs of the selected community focus
                    area while adhering to our mission of inclusivity,
                    accessibility, and ethical design. Each website should also
                    celebrate the unique characteristics of its chosen community
                    and support meaningful interaction and engagement.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Additional Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
                <p>Each website must serve two key groups:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Community Members: Individuals within the selected
                        community who seek representation, resources, and
                        connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        General Audience: Broader society, who can use the
                        website to learn about the community and its
                        contributions.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Accessibility must be prioritised to ensure seamless
                    interaction for all users, including those relying on
                    assistive technologies.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Project Goals</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Represent and celebrate the identity of the chosen
                        community, recognising and representing the diversity
                        within the community rather than relying on stereotypes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide clear, accessible information and resources to
                        users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Foster meaningful connections and support within the
                        community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure ethical, inclusive, and culturally sensitive
                        design principles are upheld.
