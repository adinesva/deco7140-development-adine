                    for dynamic websites that align with CCI’s mission and

                <p>
                    We are commissioning the development of dynamic,
                    user-friendly websites that
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 3">
                        represent and support different communities.</span
                    >
                    Each website should serve as a central hub where community
                    members can share resources, highlight events, and foster
                    meaningful connections. The websites must not include any
                    form of commercial activity, such as advertising or selling
                    products. However, it is acceptable to promote resources,
                    events, or services that are directly beneficial to the
                    community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The websites must be accessible, mobile-friendly, and
                    reflect the diverse needs of the selected community focus
                    area while adhering to our mission of inclusivity,
                    accessibility, and ethical design. Each website should also
                    celebrate the unique characteristics of its chosen community
                    and support meaningful interaction and engagement.
